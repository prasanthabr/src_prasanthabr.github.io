One of the features of my work that was brought starkly in focus while moving from India to New Zealand has been the importance of communication. 
While in India, the focus has always been on getting better technically, while being able to hold an engaging conversation with your client, the Kiwi customer in all his politeness and political correctness, need a level of engagement of a higher order.
To be honest, I have struggled to find my footing, deciding whether I mimic the average Kiwi and be someone I am not or stay true to who I am while being respectfully helpful.
All of these have made me look more closely at communication as a skill that needs to be nurtured and carefully cultivated.

The Greeks spoke about the art of persuasion about 2000 years ago. It is arguably the most important skill in the knowledge industry. Today, everyone is persuading someone to back his idea, to choose his design or simply put money against often intangible services.

##### the rhetorical devices

There are five rhetorical devices that Aristotle identified that help the journey towards a persuasion master.

* ### Ethos or Character

Simply put the credibility of the speaker. Your audience would be judgemental - why should I listen to him? What makes him special? Does he even know what he is talking about.

References to establish your credibility, on why you stand apart and is a leading light in your sphere is something that would make your audience 

But the positive here is that studies show that humans are wired to trust
