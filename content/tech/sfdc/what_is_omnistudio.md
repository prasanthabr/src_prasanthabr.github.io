Over the years Salesforce has morphed its offering basket to grow from a CRM to a platform to now industry specific solutions. Salesforce is now at a stage where it offers early versions of industry specific solutions

This pivot is perhaps inevitable given the position Salesforce now occupies in enterprise tech stacks.
