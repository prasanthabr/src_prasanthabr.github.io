### Notes to Self

##### Apex Triggers
a before trigger is riding the wave and can make changes on the record -- so its natural that it does not support a DML statement
context variables indicate the triggering values and the behaviour of the trigger

addError - to cause a fatal error and prevent further execution -- this is interesting!
