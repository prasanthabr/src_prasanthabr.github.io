This was really a post that was written two years back on the list of things I want to do; two years went and I don't feel I gave it a decent go.  
And this is in no way an isolated event - I make plans and then life hits you and what I want to do goes out of the window.  

A combination of things are forcing me to articulate the goals and seeing how I can visualize and achieve it, this time.  

The things that inspired me towards this:  
* Read somewhere that the fundamental of anything that we are learning are like tree trunks and the detail are like the leaves of a tree. We seem to focus on the detail - often driven by the need to quickly turn around, without understanding the fundamentals of the issue.
* Listened to a talk by Simon Sinek about the chemical rewards in our body; which leads to why writing down and visualizing our goals would fit into the body's reward mechanism https://vimeo.com/79899786

So, in the spirit of building trunks and bettering the odds that I will reach it:  

Before Oct 1st 2021

1. You are in the tech industry; understand the fundamentals
    1. Complete with aces the CS50 Program
    1. Pick up a language (I know a bit of Ruby - but maybe Go) and implement all the examples in Grokking Algorithms
    1. Understand well the Big-O notation and write a blog post on it
2. You are getting older, fatter, slower; you have seen what exercise can do
    1. Do a Big 3 circuit with a 20kg kettlebell for 120 days with no cheat days
    1. Get your weight down to 90 kgs
    1. Do 10 full burpees for 60 days with no cheat days  


*You know your long shot goal; do not work on that till 1st Oct 2021*
