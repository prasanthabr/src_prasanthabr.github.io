In a world defined by cut throat competition, with no one really looking out for you; How do you shine with the skills that you have?  

> Here's to the crazy ones.  
> The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.  
> The round pegs in the square holes.  
> The ones who see things differently. 
> 
> They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo.  
> You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.  
> About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.  
> Because they change things.
> 
> They push the human race forward.  
> And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.  
> Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

# Self-Confidence  
The belief that regardless of the odds and regardless of how improbable and impossible it seems, you alone are enough to achieve what you aim to do.

*(noun)â€‹ confidence in yourself and your abilities*

**Repetition**  
The master has failed more times that the apprentice has even tried.  
Persistence, with iterative learning is the key to building your self confidence.  

**Tenacity & Grit**  
It is easy to give up when the going gets tough, when there is no light at the end of the tunnel.  
Build your mental fortitude to go beyond the times that you think is reasonable.  

**Self-Talk**  
There are enough people in the world telling you that you can't do it; why should you be one of them?  
While avoiding the hubris, remind yourself in the quiet times about who you are and what made you.  

**Self-Affirmation**  
For those times of self doubt, write-up a brag sheet to show you what you have achieved and what you have done.  
Reaffirm the positives to tide over the feelings of doubt. Push through those patches of self doubt and win to build further on your self confidence.

**Your company**  
Run from the people who tear you down and tell you that you are not good enough.  
And in the cases you can avoid them, tune them out and fall back on self affirmation.  
No one knows you as well as you know yourself.

**Catch them when they are good!**  
Avoid correcting people when they make a less than ideal impression. Show them and yourself when you are doing something right.

**Interpret Feedback**  
See the possibilities in the feedback and take feedback the way you want to take it.  
Do not let feedback cow you down. Work hard, but remember you know yourself far better than anyone else who is giving you feedback.
