* [_of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine..._](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/22MqWw0PKFLLpDLhhSgk278/heres-looking-at-you-why-is-casablanca-so-very-quotable)

* [Nothing really matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ), unless you want it to. 

> We are not now that strength which in old days  
> Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,  
> One equal temper of heroic hearts,  
> Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will  
> To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.  


> Here's to the crazy ones.  
> The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.  
> The round pegs in the square holes.  
> The ones who see things differently. 
> 
> They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo.  
> You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.  
> About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.  
> Because they change things.
> 
> They push the human race forward.  
> And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.  
> Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.
