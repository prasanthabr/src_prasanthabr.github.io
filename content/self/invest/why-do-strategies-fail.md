Making strategic decicions in todays world is hard.
New business models can attract sufficent funding and reach due to the
environment and landscape.
As a leader the job is to keep finding ways to extract value from opportunities.

Often this unravels due to a focus on a single aspect of a strategy, as opposed
to a holistic outlook

New world startups and traditional established firms have different challenges
that they need to protect against.

Startups are very good at identifying opportunites, and unmet needs, but they
fail since the strategies do not detail how to capture and _retain_ a large set
of that traget group.

Traditionalists often are blindsides by the changing landscape from innovative
startups.
