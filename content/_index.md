[the majority is always wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGFep6rncY)  

When the answers have changed; the things that took you here will not take you where you want to be; on avoiding mental myopia

[_of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine..._](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/22MqWw0PKFLLpDLhhSgk278/heres-looking-at-you-why-is-casablanca-so-very-quotable)

There is no clear blue day to live life to the fullest;  
this is it; whatever you have been dealt; live it to the fullest;  
Keep seeking anew; push regrets away; be the best version of you;  
 
[Nothing really matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ), unless you want it to.  

> We are not now that strength which in old days  
> Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,  
> One equal temper of heroic hearts,  
> Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will  
> To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
